-   Here is the [guide to writing in markdown](https://appcode.app/writing-in-markdown/) for contributing to the content on AppCode.

# Notes

During the markdown linting and format of the markdown files you may notice some characters are escaped, this is normal for [Remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark). Here is more infomation on what characters to expect that will be escaped.

> Markdown is incredibly complex. Almost all ASCII punctuation characters can cause something to happen depending on what comes before or after them. Depending on what plugins you use, any ASCII punctuation character could theoretically thus result in an escape. Here are the defaults: https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast-util-to-markdown/blob/main/lib/unsafe.js. @remarkjs/remark
