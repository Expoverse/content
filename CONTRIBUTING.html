<p>Once you have chosen a topic, you can start writing your content. You can use any text editor or IDE to write your content, but it is recommended that text, code snippets, and examples are formatted correctly in Markdown.</p>
<p>You can learn more about how we use <a href="https://appcode.app/writing-in-markdown/">Markdown to create documents on AppCode here</a>.</p>
<p>When writing your content, make sure that it is clear, concise, and easy to understand. Use <a href="https://appcode.app/writing-in-markdown/#headings">headings</a>, subheadings, <a href="https://appcode.app/writing-in-markdown/#lists">bullet points / lists</a>, and <a href="https://appcode.app/writing-in-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks">code blocks</a> to organize your content and make it easier to read.</p>
<h2 id="submit-your-content"><a href="#submit-your-content" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" rel="bookmark">Submit your content</a></h2>
<h3 id="create-your-content-in-markdown"><a href="#create-your-content-in-markdown" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" rel="bookmark">Create your content in Markdown</a></h3>
<p>Markdown is a simple markup language that allows you to create formatted text using plain text syntax. To create your content in Markdown, you can use any text editor, such as Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text.</p>
<p>When writing your content, make sure to follow the Markdown syntax rules to ensure that your text is formatted correctly. You can find a comprehensive guide to Markdown syntax on the Markdown Guide website <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/">https://www.markdownguide.org/</a> and the <a href="https://appcode.app/writing-in-markdown/">one provided on AppCode</a>.</p>
<h3 id="fork-the-repository"><a href="#fork-the-repository" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" rel="bookmark">Fork the repository</a></h3>
<p>The next step is to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo">fork the repository</a> where you want to contribute your content. To do this, go to the repository on GitHub and click on the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-new-branch"><a href="#create-a-new-branch" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" rel="bookmark">Create a new branch</a></h3>
<p>After forking the repository, you need to create a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository">new branch for your changes</a>. This will help you keep your changes separate from the main branch and make it easier to submit your changes as a pull request.</p>
<p>To create a new branch, go to the repository in your GitHub account and click on the "Branch: main" button. Then, type in a name for your new branch and click on the "Create branch" button.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-new-markdown-file"><a href="#create-a-new-markdown-file" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" rel="bookmark">Create a new Markdown file</a></h3>
<p>In your new branch, create a new Markdown file for your content. You can do this by clicking on the "Add file" button and selecting "Create new file". Make sure to give your Markdown file a descriptive name that reflects the content that it contains.</p>
<h3 id="write-your-content-in-the-markdown-file"><a href="#write-your-content-in-the-markdown-file" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" rel="bookmark">Write your content in the Markdown file</a></h3>
<p>Open the new Markdown file in your text editor and write your content using Markdown syntax. Make sure to follow the syntax rules and use formatting such as headings, lists, and code blocks to make your content easy to read and understand.</p>
<h3 id="commit-and-push-your-changes"><a href="#commit-and-push-your-changes" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" rel="bookmark">Commit and push your changes</a></h3>
<p>After you have finished writing your content, save the Markdown file and commit your changes to your branch. To do this, go to the repository on GitHub and click on the "Compare &#x26; pull request" button. This will take you to a page where you can review your changes and create a pull request.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-pull-request"><a href="#create-a-pull-request" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" rel="bookmark">Create a pull request</a></h3>
<p>On the pull request page, make sure that your changes are being made from your new branch to the main branch of the repository. Give your pull request a descriptive title and provide a brief description of the changes that you have made. You can read <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">how to create a pull request on GitHub here</a>.</p>
<p>After you have created your pull request, the repository owner will review your changes and provide feedback. You may need to make additional changes or updates based on their feedback before your changes are accepted and merged into the main branch of the repository.</p>
<p>Once you have submitted your content, you will need to wait for feedback from the AppCode team. They will review your content and provide feedback on any changes that need to be made. Make sure to address any feedback promptly and resubmit your content for review.</p>
<h2 id="publish-your-content"><a href="#publish-your-content" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" rel="bookmark">Publish your content</a></h2>
<p>After your content in the pull request has been reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the <a href="https://github.com/Expoverse/content">master content branch</a> and published on the <a href="https://appcode.app/">AppCode website</a> after some checks and formating tasks are ran. Your ontribution will be acknowledged by the AppCode community by linking to your Github profile in several locations, including the Markdown file that was created or edited.</p>
<p>Contributing to the AppCode website is a great way to share your knowledge and expertise with web development community.
